        <h2>Climbing with Sean</h2>
        <p>
          I haven't been on a climbing route in over 25 years. At 61 years old I wonder if I have a few ascents left in me and if I could do them with my son. One of the routes I have in mind is the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/regular-route/105847227">Regular Route</a> on Fairview Dome in Yosemite park just east of Tenaya Lake. This is a really fun 5-6 pitch climb primarily a 5.7 to 5.8 difficulty level with a couple of 5.9+ moves one of which is a really fun overhang. The walk off down the back of Fairview Dome is easy and has great views. I've led this route aproimately 6-8 times and know how fun it is.
          <br><br>
          The other route I'm interested in checking out with Sean is the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/east-face/105792077">East Face Route</a> of Mt. Whitney. There is an incredible exposed fresh air traverse that makes you feel like your in air. This climb has a long approach and you need to aclimate to the altitude. It ranges from scrambling up to 5.7 difficulty and ends at the summit. The combination of climbing and then camping in the desert under the stars is too good to pass up. Doing this climb includes a road trip from Sonoma County heading east and down Rt. 395 on the east side of the Sierras.

        <p>
          Being out in the wilderness and stretching my boundaries when I climb has been a source of exhilaration, fear, serenity, doubt and triumph.  Each climb gives me a bit more understanding about myself, I get filled with more than me and get to take some of that home. I want to share this with Sean. <br><br>
          The first step is getting in climbing shape which means yoga, biking and climbing. A year of preparation will make this dream happen.
