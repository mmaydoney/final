        <h2>Climbing with Sean</h2>
        <p>
          I haven't been on a climbing route in over 25 years. At 61 years old I wonder if I have a few ascents left in me and if I could do them with my son. One of the routes I have in mind is the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/regular-route/105847227">Regular Route</a> on Fairview Dome in Yosemite park just east of Tenaya Lake. This is a really fun 5-6 pitch climb primarily a 5.7 to 5.8 difficulty level with a couple of 5.9+ moves one of which is a really fun overhang. The walk off down the back of Fairview Dome is easy and has great views. I've led this route aproimately 6-8 times and know how cool it is.

        <p>
          The route I'm most interested in checking out with Sean is the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/east-face/105792077">East Face Route</a> of Mt. Whitney. There is an incredible exposed fresh air traverse that makes you feel like your in air. This climb has a long approach and you need to aclimate to the altitude. It ranges from scrambling up 4.0 to 5.7 difficulty and ends at the summit.

          <br><br>
          The first step is getting in climbing shape which means a lot of yoga, biking and climbing. I still have my old harness and I need to do some work to fit into it again. A year of preparation will be what makes the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/east-face/105792077">East Face Route</a> part of this dream happen.
